# rust_algorithms_datastructures

This repository contains implementations of a variety of algorithms and datastructures in Rust. I write these to both practice writing Rust, keeping in shape with regards to D&A and producing implementations I can refer to in the future.

At the moment this repository contains the following:

### Algorithms
- Quicksort


### Datastructures
- Segment Tree
